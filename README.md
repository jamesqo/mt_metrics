# mt_metrics
An exploration of semantic parsing as translation metrics, psuedo-references with semantic parsing, properties of BLEU etc.

## Installation
Download all the necessary files using `make`. This will download and unpack 2017 Direct Assesment (DA) testing data, along with 2015 and 2016 DA data for development.
This setup is identical to the WMT'17 metric task setup.

Install jupyter notebook and nltk (more requirements to come). You should now be able to run all the code.
