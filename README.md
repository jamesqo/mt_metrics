# mt_metrics
An exploration of semantic parsing as translation metrics, psuedo-references with semantic parsing, properties of BLEU etc.

## Installation
Download all the necessary files using `make`. This will download and unpack 2017 Direct Assesment (DA) testing data, along with 2015 and 2016 DA data for development.
This setup is identical to the WMT'17 metric task setup.

## Requirements

You will need to install Jupyter Notebook to use the ipynb files.

Run this command to install all Python dependencies:

```
pip install matplotlib nltk pandas
```
